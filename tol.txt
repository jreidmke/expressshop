This won't be too bad. An Express Shopping list. 

First, we'll structure out the modules

Then the routes

server.js
app.js
router.js
fakeDb.js*

what does an item looks like?

{'name': "cheetos", "price": 1.45}

Except with double quotes at the beginning :P

OK, let's check those routes.

GET /items returns array of items

POST /items adds item to shopping list (accepts JSON => app.use(express.json())) and responds with msg:

{added: {name: food price: 6.66}}

GET /items/:name returns C

PATCH /items/:name takes in JSON and returns 

{updated: {“name”: “popsicle”, “price”: 1.45}}

DELETE /items/:name returns {message: deleted}
